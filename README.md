# dfsp-spirit.github.io
My personal website, generated with Jekyll.

This is my new website. The website is build with Jekyll, a static site generator written in Ruby. The current state from this repository is always visible at [dfsp-spirit.github.io](https://dfsp-spirit.github.io/).

This is now also served from [rcmd.org/ts](https://rcmd.org/ts/) via a CNAME. The advantage of this website over my old, homebrew HTML solution is that it is more mobile friendly and looks a bit more professional. The disadvantage is a more complicated setup, and that it requires Ruby. Note: *GitHub takes away the major part of the Ruby pain though: you only need to get it to work once for the initial repo setup unless you want to preview locally before committing.*
