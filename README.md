# dfsp-spirit.github.io
My personal website, generated with Jekyll.

This is a work-in-progess rewrite of my website. The website is build with Jekyll, a static site generator written in Ruby. The current state from this repository is always visible at [dfsp-spirit.github.io](https://dfsp-spirit.github.io/).

Once it is ready, this page will replace my current website at [rcmd.org/ts](https://rcmd.org/ts/). The advantage of this website over my old homebrew HTML solution is that it is more mobile friendly and looks a bit more professional. The disadvantage is a more complicated setup, and that it requires Ruby. GitHub takes away at least some of the Ruby pain though.
