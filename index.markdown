## Welcome

*This website version is currently work in progress. Please ignore it. My website can be found at [rcmd.org/ts/](https://rcmd.org/ts/)*.

This is the professional website of Tim Schäfer. I am a bioinformatician and neuroscientist. I currently work as a research software engineer in the [Fries Lab at ESI](https://www.esi-frankfurt.de/people/pascalfries/).

I have contributed to a range of open source projects and I am the author and maintainer of some neuroimaging software tools, including the [freesurferformats](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/freesurferformats) and [fsbrain](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain) packages for R, and libraries providing access to neuroimaging data for C++, Julia, Rust and Python.

I am especially interested in spatial geometry, 3D imaging, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing (HPC). You can find the source code for most of my projects on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit).

You may be interested in my [projects](./projects), or the list of [my publications](./publications).
