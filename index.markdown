This is the professional website of Tim Schäfer. I am a bioinformatician and neuroscientist. I currently work as a research software engineer in the Biodiversity Informatics group at [Senckenberg Society for Nature Research](https://senckenberg.de).

I have contributed to a range of open source projects and I am the author and maintainer of some neuroimaging software tools, including the [freesurferformats](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/freesurferformats) and [fsbrain](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain) packages for R, and libraries providing access to neuroimaging data for C++, Julia, Rust and Python.

I am especially interested in spatial geometry, 3D imaging, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. You can find the source code for most of my software on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit).

You may be interested in my [projects](./projects), or the list of [my publications](./publications). If you're into the semantic web you may be interested in my <link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml" title="FOAF" href="foaf.rdf" >FOAF</>.
